<h2>How to use this site</h2>

<p>
This site is set up to streamline the efforts to make and share split-Gal4 
lines.
</p>

<h3>Sharing a line</h3>

<p>
To share a line without an account, please use the <a href="{% url 'add_line' %}">Add a line</a>
link and fill the form. If you have logged in, your email lab will be
pre-filled as the contributor.
</p>

<p>
To share many lines at once, you can register and verify your account, and use 
the template from <a href="{% url 'upload' %}">Batch upload</a>.
</p>
<h3>Why would I need an account?</h3>

<p>
The lines you shared will be associated with your account. The account grants
you access to a <a href="/admin">Dashboard</a> to manage and update your lines.
</p>

<p>
In addition, after sharing your lines, your account will have access to the
lines that are marked as internal sharing only.
